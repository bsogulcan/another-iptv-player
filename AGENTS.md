# AGENTS.md - Flutter IPTV Player Project Guide

## Build & Development Commands
- `flutter pub get` - Install dependencies
- `flutter run` - Run app in debug mode
- `flutter build apk` - Build Android APK
- `flutter build ios` - Build iOS app

## Code Style Guidelines
- Follow Flutter/Dart official conventions using flutter_lints
- Use camelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for classes/types
- Private members use underscore prefix (_variable)
- Import order: dart/flutter → package imports → relative imports
- Prefer single quotes, const constructors, async/await patterns
- Use null safety (? and ! operators appropriately)
- Error handling with try-catch and proper error messages
- Use Provider pattern for state management, Drift for database
- Testing with flutter_test framework and mockito for mocking

## Localization (i18n)
- **IMPORTANT**: `app_localizations_*.dart` files are auto-generated by Flutter i18n
- Only edit `.arb` files in `lib/l10n/` directory (e.g., `app_en.arb`, `app_tr.arb`)
- After modifying `.arb` files, run `flutter gen-l10n` to regenerate localization files
- Supported languages: English (en), Turkish (tr), Spanish (es), French (fr), German (de), Portuguese (pt), Russian (ru), Hindi (hi), Arabic (ar), Chinese (zh)
- Add new translations to ALL language `.arb` files for consistency
- Do NOT manually edit generated `app_localizations*.dart` or `app_localizations.dart` files
